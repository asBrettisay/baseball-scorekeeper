# baseball-scorekeeper
This is a scorekeeper app for the great game of Baseball

I made this app as a project while studying at DevMountain. This is a 'no-server' type project.

bower install and npm install in order to get all the dependencies.

At the moment, this is a mobile only site, so shrink the browser view down or use dev mode to view the website.
